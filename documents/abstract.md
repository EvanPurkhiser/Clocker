## Clocker - A time tracker for invoicing (Evan Purkhiser)

Clocker is a online web application for professionals to manage and track time
spent working on client's projects. The application can be used to "clock in and
out" for a period of time, allowing the user to record a description of the work
done. The user can then generate a PDF invoice from the time entires,
simplifying workflow and reducing overhead. The application is written in Ruby
using the Ruby on Rails framework. The primary goal of this project is to not
only create something that is useful, but also to become familiar with the Ruby
language and the RoR framework.
